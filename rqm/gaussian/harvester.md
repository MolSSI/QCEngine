# Feature: Gaussian Harness — Harvester <!-- rq-9d12489e -->

This document specifies the output-parsing layer for the Gaussian harness. All parsing
lives in `qcengine/programs/gaussian/harvester.py`. The harvester uses **cclib** as the
primary parsing backend, supplemented by regex extraction for quantities that cclib does
not expose (e.g. normal/abnormal termination, version identification, error messages).

## cclib Integration <!-- rq-bb0a5d96 -->

cclib is called once per log file via:

```python
import io
import cclib

ccdata = cclib.io.ccopen(io.StringIO(log_content)).parse()
```

The `ccdata` object exposes parsed attributes used as follows:

| cclib attribute | Units (cclib) | Conversion | QCEngine usage |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| `ccdata.scfenergies[-1]` | eV | (fallback only) | SCF/HF/DFT total energy |
| `ccdata.mpenergies[-1][-1]` | eV | (fallback only) | MP2 total energy |
| `ccdata.ccenergies[-1]` | eV | (fallback only) | CCSD or CCSD(T) total energy |
| `ccdata.grads[-1]` | Hartree/Bohr | negate (forces → gradient) | Gradient array |
| `ccdata.atomcoords[-1]` | Ångström | × Bohr/Å | Geometry for output molecule (standard orientation) |
| `ccdata.atomnos` | atomic numbers | via qcel periodic table | Element symbols |
| `ccdata.nbasis` | integer | none | Number of basis functions |
| `ccdata.nmo` | integer | none | Number of molecular orbitals |
| `ccdata.homos` | integer array | +1 for count | N alpha/beta electrons |
| `ccdata.moments[1]` | Debye | none | Dipole moment vector |
| `ccdata.atomcharges["mulliken"]` | e | none | Mulliken partial charges |

### cclib Limitations <!-- rq-f6537c40 -->

Two significant cclib limitations require direct log parsing as the primary strategy
for energies and the Hessian:

**1. Energy precision loss (eV conversion factor mismatch):**

cclib internally stores energies in electron volts (eV). It parses the Hartree value
from the Gaussian log, multiplies by its own Hartree→eV factor (`27.21138505`), and
stores the result. When the harvester converts back to Hartree using qcelemental's
factor (`qcel.constants.conversion_factor("eV", "hartree")` = `0.036749322481536`,
corresponding to `27.21138602` Hartree→eV), the round-trip introduces a relative error
of approximately `3.6e-9`. For typical SCF energies (~100 Hartree), this produces
absolute errors of ~3.6e-7 Hartree, which exceeds the tolerances required by the
cross-program alignment tests (`atol = 2e-7`).

**Resolution:** Energies are parsed directly from the Gaussian log via regex (see
"Direct Energy Parsing" below). cclib energy attributes are used only as a fallback
if the regex fails to match.

**2. Hessian not extracted by cclib:**

cclib does not parse the "Force constants in Cartesian coordinates" block from
Gaussian frequency (`Freq`) calculations. The `ccdata.hessian` attribute is always
absent for Gaussian logs.

**Resolution:** The Hessian is parsed directly from the log via `_parse_force_constants()`
(see "Hessian Parsing" below).

### Coordinate Frame <!-- rq-f4900ee1 -->

cclib's `atomcoords[-1]` returns geometry in Gaussian's **standard orientation**
(the internally reoriented frame). This affects frame alignment logic — see
"Output Molecule Construction" below.

**Important**: Gaussian reports atomic **forces** (= −dE/dR) in its output; cclib
preserves this sign convention in `ccdata.grads`. The gradient (= +dE/dR) is obtained by
**negating** the forces array:

```python
gradient = -ccdata.grads[-1]   # shape (natoms, 3)
```

## Direct Energy Parsing <!-- rq-c20746b1 -->

Energies are parsed directly from the Gaussian log in Hartree to avoid the cclib eV
round-trip. The following regex patterns are used:

| Energy | Regex | Format |
|--------|-------|--------|
| SCF/HF/DFT | `r"SCF Done:\s+E\(\S+\)\s*=\s*([-\d.]+)"` | Plain float |
| MP2 | `r"EUMP2\s*=\s*([-\d.DE+]+)"` | Fortran D-exponent |
| CCSD(T) | `r"CCSD\(T\)=\s*([-\d.DE+]+)"` | Fortran D-exponent |
| CCSD | `r"DE\(Corr\)=\s*[-\d.]+\s+E\(CORR\)=\s*([-\d.]+)"` (last match) | Plain float |

Fortran D-exponent values (e.g. `-0.76276030623D+02`) are converted by replacing
`D` with `E` before calling `float()`.

If a regex does not match, the harvester falls back to cclib's eV-based energy with
the qcelemental conversion factor.

## Hessian Parsing <!-- rq-c5b27d26 -->

The Hessian is parsed from the "Force constants in Cartesian coordinates:" block in
the Gaussian Freq log. This block contains the lower triangle of the symmetric
force constant matrix in Fortran D-exponent format, printed in column groups of 5.

The parser (`_parse_force_constants`) reconstructs the full `(3N, 3N)` symmetric matrix.

**Coordinate frame for force constants:** Gaussian prints force constants in the
**input orientation** (the coordinates from the `.com` file), NOT in the standard
orientation. This is significant for frame alignment:

- When `fix_com=True` and `fix_orientation=True`: the return molecule is `in_mol`
  (input frame) and the Hessian is already in the input frame — no rotation needed.
- When `fix_com=False` or `fix_orientation=False`: the return molecule is in the
  standard/calc frame. The Hessian must be transformed from input→calc frame using
  `in_mol.align(calc_mol)`.

## Other Regex Items <!-- rq-0743e952 -->

| Item | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Normal termination | `"Normal termination of Gaussian"` in log |
| Abnormal termination | absence of the above line, or `"Error termination"` |
| Gaussian version (for provenance) | `r"Gaussian\s+(\d+),\s+Revision\s+([\w.]+),"` |

## Feature API <!-- rq-1a01df8f -->

### `harvest(in_mol: Molecule, method: str, log_content: str) -> Tuple[PreservingDict, Optional[np.ndarray], Optional[np.ndarray], Molecule]` <!-- rq-d9434480 -->

**Purpose**: parses the Gaussian log file and returns all QC data needed to construct an
`AtomicResult`.

**Parameters**:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `in_mol` | `qcelemental.models.Molecule` | The input molecule (used for alignment and NRE cross-check). |
| `method` | `str` | Lowercase QCSchema method string (e.g. `"hf"`, `"mp2"`, `"b3lyp"`, `"ccsd(t,full)"`). Gaussian-specific sub-options like `,full` are normalised internally (e.g. `"ccsd(t,full)"` → `"ccsd(t)"` for energy extraction). |
| `log_content` | `str` | Full text of `gaussian.log`. |

**Returns** a 4-tuple `(qcvars, grad, hess, out_mol)`:

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `qcvars` | `PreservingDict` | QC variables (see below). |
| `grad` | `Optional[np.ndarray]` | Shape `(3*natoms,)` gradient in Hartree/Bohr, or `None`. |
| `hess` | `Optional[np.ndarray]` | Shape `(3*natoms, 3*natoms)` Hessian in Hartree/Bohr², or `None`. |
| `out_mol` | `Molecule` | Output molecule aligned to `in_mol`. |

**Raises**:
- `ValueError` if no coordinate information can be extracted from the log. <!-- rq-4336c3cd -->
- `ValueError` if the nuclear repulsion energy of the parsed geometry deviates from <!-- rq-90604835 -->
  `in_mol.nuclear_repulsion_energy()` by more than `1.0e-3` Hartree.
- Any `cclib` exception is allowed to propagate (caller wraps in `UnknownError`).

### QC Variables Populated <!-- rq-929a262a -->

> **Priority note:** The `properties` field on `AtomicResult` (populated via
> `build_atomicproperties`) is the proper QCSchema interface for consumers.
> `extras["qcvars"]` is retained for diagnostics and compatibility with other
> harnesses, but `properties` mappings are the primary contract.  All energy,
> gradient, and hessian variables listed below have existing mappings in
> `qcvars_to_atomicproperties`.  `"MULLIKEN CHARGES"` and `"DIPOLE MOMENT"`
> do not have `properties` mappings (the dipole mapping expects a vector
> `"HF DIPOLE"`, not the scalar magnitude stored here).

The following variables are placed in `qcvars` based on the method:

**All calculations**:
- `"NUCLEAR REPULSION ENERGY"` — from parsed geometry. <!-- rq-0753cd03 -->
- `"HF TOTAL ENERGY"` — from direct log parsing (SCF Done line), falling back to `ccdata.scfenergies[-1]` converted from eV. <!-- rq-37f40e92 -->
- `"SCF TOTAL ENERGY"` — same value as `"HF TOTAL ENERGY"` (required by standard suite contracts). <!-- rq-f59a07b8 -->
- `"CURRENT REFERENCE ENERGY"` — same value as `"HF TOTAL ENERGY"` (required by standard suite contracts). <!-- rq-0d2711f1 -->
- `"CURRENT ENERGY"` — set to the highest-level energy available (see below). <!-- rq-c5165f1f -->
- `"N ATOMS"` — from `len(ccdata.atomnos)`. <!-- rq-463ef385 -->
- `"N BASIS FUNCTIONS"` — from `ccdata.nbasis` (when available). <!-- rq-17e8c0f7 -->
- `"N MOLECULAR ORBITALS"` — from `ccdata.nmo` (when available). <!-- rq-7f2c22fd -->
- `"N ALPHA ELECTRONS"` — from `ccdata.homos[0] + 1`. <!-- rq-6453046a -->
- `"N BETA ELECTRONS"` — from `ccdata.homos[-1] + 1` (or same as alpha for closed-shell). <!-- rq-0cdd386d -->

**Method-specific**:

| Method | Variables set |
|--------|--------------|
| `"hf"` or `"scf"` or DFT | `"HF TOTAL ENERGY"`, `"CURRENT ENERGY"` |
| `"mp2"` | `"MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY"` (= MP2 total − HF total), `"MP2 TOTAL ENERGY"`, `"CURRENT ENERGY"` |
| `"ccsd"` | `"CCSD CORRELATION ENERGY"`, `"CCSD TOTAL ENERGY"`, `"CURRENT ENERGY"` |
| `"ccsd(t)"` | `"CCSD CORRELATION ENERGY"`, `"CCSD TOTAL ENERGY"`, `"CCSD(T) CORRELATION ENERGY"`, `"CCSD(T) TOTAL ENERGY"`, `"CURRENT ENERGY"` |

**Properties driver extras** (when cclib attributes are available):
- `"MULLIKEN CHARGES"` — from `ccdata.atomcharges["mulliken"]`. <!-- rq-c7fd08b5 -->
- `"DIPOLE MOMENT"` — magnitude of `ccdata.moments[1]` in Debye. <!-- rq-943856cc -->

**Gradient** (when present):
- The negated forces array is transformed via `mill.align_gradient()` and returned as
  `grad` with shape `(3*natoms,)`. The runner stores this in `qcvars` as
  `"CURRENT GRADIENT"` and `"<METHOD> TOTAL GRADIENT"` with shape `(natoms, 3)`.

**Hessian** (when present):
- Parsed from the log's "Force constants in Cartesian coordinates" block (see
  "Hessian Parsing" above), transformed to the output molecule frame as needed,
  and returned as `hess` with shape `(3*natoms, 3*natoms)`. The runner sets
  `"CURRENT HESSIAN"` and `"<METHOD> TOTAL HESSIAN"` in `qcvars`.

### Output Molecule Construction and Frame Alignment <!-- rq-8d6fc024 -->

The output molecule is constructed from `ccdata.atomnos` and `ccdata.atomcoords[-1]`
(converted from Ångström to Bohr) as `calc_mol`. Note that cclib returns coordinates in
Gaussian's **standard orientation** (internally reoriented), not the input orientation.

Frame handling follows the same pattern as the GAMESS harvester:

- **`fix_com=True` and `fix_orientation=True`**: the return molecule is `in_mol`
  (preserving the input frame). An alignment mill is computed via
  `calc_mol.align(in_mol)` and applied to the gradient to transform it from standard
  orientation to the input frame. The Hessian (from direct log parsing) is already in
  the input frame and requires no rotation.

- **Otherwise** (free frame): the return molecule is produced by
  `in_mol.align(calc_mol)` (adopting the standard orientation frame). The gradient
  mill is identity (no transformation needed since cclib's gradient is already in
  standard orientation). The Hessian must be transformed from input→standard frame
  via `in_mol.align(calc_mol)`.

The `mill.align_gradient()` and `mill.align_hessian()` methods handle atom reordering
and rotation as needed.
